The Forward Networks solution is designed to help network teams eliminate network outages and reduce time to remediate errors. Its platform enables engineers and operators to visualize and search complex networks, debug configuration problems, verify network-wide policy implementations, and predict network behavior prior to deploying changes. Forward Networks builds a software replica of an entire network to analyze its behavior. Using the network copy, the software traces, indexes, and stores the collected data, monitoring things like end-to-end behavior, verification of the network’s forwarding behavior and security posture, and close monitoring of configuration changes.",

    "about": "Most businesses want to deliver the extraordinary service that makes their customers feel like the only one. But as a company grows, it becomes incredibly difficult to deliver this kind of service to hundreds, thousands, or millions of customers. Most businesses choose scale and efficiency over quality — and customer experience suffers. At Front, we equip companies to have it all — scale, efficiency, and quality, human-to-human interactions that lead to extraordinary customer experiences. And along the way, we make sure teams are working happier too. How? Front is a hub for customer communication that allows companies to offer tailor-made service at scale. Front looks and feels like your email inbox with a few very important differences: teammates collaborate in the same place where external messages are sent and received, and behind the scenes, robust workflows and integrations power the efficiency and insights typically found in a CRM. More than 6,500 businesses use Front to work together to send out the best replies faster, keep messages organized across channels, and always maintain a personal touch. The result is premier, personalized service that scales with your business — and a team that works together as one.",

Every such application is custom built. We should wonder — why? The desktop computer is an important interface for business applications. Problem is, it wasn’t built to perform modern business operations. The problem lies in the operating system. Where Android and iOS were designed to allow applications to interact with one another, desktop computing simply wasn’t. This means that operations such as deal analysis and loan processing, which toggle between human data and computer data, can’t be performed without the assistance of a human being. It’s not only inefficient for businesses but utterly uninspiring for workers. Instabase is on a mission to fix that: to rethink the way we use apps and the way those apps work together to improve business processes and empower innovators to solve problems on a larger scale.

Between growing e-commerce and a strong economy, demand for trucking is on the rise. The trucking industry faces major problems: a shortage of drivers, difficult working conditions, and extremely high turnover. According to the American Trucking Association, the industry faced a shortage of 51,000 commercial truck drivers at the end of 2017. Long-haul trucking is primed for autonomous technology. Highway driving is more structured and predictable than urban driving. This means there are fewer decisions for drivers to make and a better fit for autonomous vehicles. We believe that autonomous trucks will play a major role in filling the gap while improving safety, enhancing truck driver quality of life, increasing efficiency, reducing congestion and emissions and creating jobs across the economy.",

At the heart of everything we do is the laid back California ethos of easy living, quality, and simplicity. We are classic. We look to past icons and interpret them with honesty and loyalty. We also look ahead and understand the modernity of future classics and the responsibility of our place amongst them. We champion anyone striving to be better and are honored when we can be a part of it. We claim simple truths and keep our promises. We truly have our customers’ best interests in mind, knowing damn well the value of a hard-earned dollar. We believe we will never be perfect but know that greatness lies in the search to be so. We make clothes. We love what we do. Initially, they set up shop in a 350 square foot garage off Abbot Kinney Boulevard. Sasha built the website and Erik created the brand’s first collection of jeans and tees. Obsessed with quality, they worked closely with a local family factory to create small batch production runs, crafting each piece using old school manufacturing techniques combined with modern technology. Buck Mason makes fashion less complicated, building each piece to last beyond a single season. Each design is a riff on an iconic American staple, combining to make a useful and effortless wardrobe. Consistency in fit, fabric and quality guide this hands on approach. Much of the product is made in the USA, where you can often find Sasha and Erik on the factory floor.",

Investing is just one part of your financial picture. So, we've introduced more ways to reach your goals and manage your money. High interest savings. Commission-free trading. And features — like automatically investing your spare change — that make it easier to save for your future. That's because we believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to make smart financial choices.",

The need for accessible mental healthcare is more important than ever. Depression and anxiety rates in America are up 300%, driven by the pandemic’s impact on parents, teachers, nurses, and frontline workers. With 70% of therapists not accepting insurance, affordable care is too expensive or tough to find, leaving too many Americans suffering without help. We believe the answer to accessibility is by supporting our incredible therapists to launch thriving, in-network private practices. The infrastructure and clinical integration in behavioral health has so much room for improvement. We’re building technology that brings practices into the 21st century and profoundly enhances the efficacy and experience of care. Our technology manages all the behind-the-scenes business obligations so therapists can focus on their clients. Everyday we feel privileged to enable and empower heroic providers to reach their full potential, knowing that our communities need heros more than ever. To achieve our lofty ambitions, we’re building an ambitious team of entrepreneurs and mission-driven go-getters. Our founders come from Harvard Medical School, Stripe, and Blackstone, and bring Grow’s mission to our internal team by promoting holistic wellness. We balance our determination with a culture that champions well-being, from unlimited PTO to Mental Health Mornings to team meditation.

With Logikcull, corporate legal teams, law firms, and government organizations of all sizes are able to organize and cull the noise by simply dragging and dropping—for fully automated, end-to-end discovery and legal holds.

Our goal is to transform the way people care for themselves and their families while creating the first real-time map of human health. We envision a world in which connected products in the home help people and communities stay healthy. We've taken the world's most ubiquitous health tool -- the thermometer -- and turned it into a far more powerful consumer experience. Our multi-award-winning product is recommended by 9 out of 10 pediatricians because it does much more than take a temperature -- it offers guidance, comfort, health tracking and more. More importantly, we've transformed it into a communication platform for parents to keep their children healthy. We've proven that we can accelerate growth through hardware sales, in-app services and data insights. Kinsa is currently working with Fortune 500 employers to drive family health objectives and is also available in 7,000 retail locations in North America.",

The platform monitors and proactively defends investors’ crypto investments from unexpected exploits and undesirable economic situations. It detects on-chain exploits in real-time and extracts invested assets on behalf of the investors without needing access to their private keys. For instance: Immuna would have detected anomalous events of unexpected approval and transfers, which led to the $120M BadgerDAO Hack. Web3 has opened up the opportunity to bring financial inclusion not just at a country level but at a global level. Unfortunately, the rising number of exploits/hacks and huge economic losses are preventing the possibility of this vision from becoming true. Immuna is here to play a large role in making this vision a reality by building an intelligence infra company that builds security engines for the web3 platforms.

We also provide advanced reporting tools and IoT devices which enable managers to make data-driven decisions that save their businesses time and money. The first version of UpKeep was developed in 2014 by our Founder & CEO, Ryan Chan, while living in his parent's garage.

Today, we’re a Series B startup that's raised $50M in venture capital and recently surpassed 100 team members. We proudly serve important industries like manufacturing, energy, agriculture, healthcare, hospitality, transportation, public works, and building management. We have become the top-rated Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) and Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) solution by constantly innovating and always putting our customers first.

We have come together out of a passion for solving problems, building a company based on the deeply held values we share, and to make social content creation effortless for brands. OUR VISION Our vision is to become the undisputed leader in social media content creation, by uniting all parts of the creation workflow into a one-stop solution for brands. Slate is the go-to platform used by the most innovative clubs in sports to create branded real-time content. Slate is already a key tool for social media sports teams at the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS, NCAA, and EPL followed by several other entertainment and media brands like Comedy Central, as well as adding top brands in fitness and beauty. Slate is a completely customizable mobile content creation app for top-tier social media teams to create branded content. When creating real-time content, enterprise social teams are forced to settle for colors that are “close” and fonts that “look less than cool”. Native options for graphics, stickers and filters are limited and don’t match the brand’s voice and image. But with today's consumer and fan in constant need of more content, there is no time to send every piece of captured media back and forth with the design team. This is when Slate jumps in to provide teams with a simple app that is fully customized to your brand; any fonts, graphics, logos, animated stickers, filters and sponsored overlays you need to create recognizable, quality content that is on brand, in real time. *Fun Fact: Slate was named to Fast Company's list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies for 2022 as No. 2 in the Video category!",

Our CEO Thibault grew up in a Deaf family and saw firsthand how the world was not accessible for them. Together with our CTO Skinner — deaf since age 2 — Thibault co-founded Ava to make live captioning of conversations as easy as turning on captions on TV. Our small but fast-growing team has reinvented AI-based speech recognition technology to be in service of people who need it the most. We dream of a 24/7 accessible world, without any communication barrier. In this pursuit, we're seeing how much communication skills are critical, yet very far from ideal, to unleash our collective potential. This is for us the last barrier to be lifted. Our mobile app empowers individuals to see in close to realtime, who says what in the conversation. Ava swiftly pairs smartphones in a room and picks up all the audio from the conversation, to show a color-coded transcript of the speakers. At business meetings, family dinners, social gatherings, you simply launch the app, and Ava does the rest. Our belief is that well-designed technology can help everyone communicate and connect better — much more effectively and authentically — so humanity can achieve the greatest things together. We want to make the seemingly impossible equation of communication 1 + 1 = 3, work every time. In other words, make 1 & 1 = 3 a reality.

In 2022, the Department of Labor estimates a global talent shortage of 40 million workers, which is expected to grow to over 85 million by 2030. For companies to win the war for talent, they need to provide a best-in-class candidate experience to recruit top talent, and our product aims at doing just that! Our founders, Lydia Han (CEO) and Chris Triolo (CTO) founded ModernLoop in December of 2020 after they saw the challenges recruiting teams had when coordinating virtual interviews. Recruiting teams are coordinating hundreds of interviews across various teams, departments, and time zones, all while working to ensure an excellent hiring experience in a dynamic and fast-paced labor market. After spending 15+ years at companies such as Facebook, Brex, Slack, and Salesforce, they understood what it took for recruiting teams to grow their organizations successfully! Lydia and Chris have built ModernLoop to serve companies of all industries and sizes to help recruiting teams interview candidates quicker, easier, and more efficiently! By creating a platform that caters to an excellent hiring experience, we’ve partnered with recruiting teams at companies like Benchling, Ramp, and Chainalysis to scale their teams and are continuing to partner with more companies to improve their team’s recruiting process.",

Forced to interact online only, COVID made the world miss travel and feel alone and unfulfilled. As big travelers ourselves, we know how travel has the power to help people connect through amazing experiences offline. But when we looked for a platform that brought everything people needed to discover, plan, book, treasure and share trips with friends into one place, we were at a loss. Instead we found marketplaces that just try to get as much of your money as possible, or apps that just do one thing (like packing). All this despite the fact that people want all their travel ideas, plans, bookings, and memories organized in one place, shareable with friends, not scattered across the web like they are today. So we decided to build Pilot. Today we’re in public beta, being used by travelers around the world. The way we see it, the future of technology should be to help people live happier lives through shared experiences offline, not doing everything possible to keep them online (like Meta).

In 2013, Uberall was born out of the vision by longtime friends and business partners David Federhen and Florian Hübner. They wanted to bridge the online and offline world more effectively, so companies could generate new customers, build customer relationships and increase their sales. They created a platform that would connect companies with local customers through search and discovery, engagement and conversion. Our SaaS platform enables multi-location brands and businesses to boost their online presence. Our customers are as large as KFC, BP and DHL (and others whose names are not entirely made of capital letters!) and as small as your local independent coffee shop or record store. Some customers work directly with us, and many more engage with our platform via Reseller Partners around the world. More than one million business locations trust the Uberall platform to manage the connections with their customers and prospects on the search engines, platforms and directories that matter.

We believe that web3 completely changes the landscape of what's possible in the world of education. Here's some of the things we're thinking about: For the first time, learning credentials can be default compatible. That means that everything being learned becomes a portable skillset that students can take with them across the internet. Web3 credentials contribute to a in a way that traditional certifications simply cannot. With a web3 architecture, content is composable, meaning anyone can make a cirriculum with other people's content and the original creators can still be credited. Want to sell courses to your audience without having to make content? Now you can. Want to issue credentials based off of someone else's cirriculum? You can do that.

Add to that, we've figured out a clever way to monetize from both sides thereby changing the financial equation from Customers paying us to us paying our customers cash back from card fees!

This allows businesses to keep all their existing Accounts Payable (or Accounts Receivable processes) in place while moving to a completely online solution. All you need to send a check is the name and email of the recipient along with the amount you are sending. Recipients do not need to sign up for any service, download any app or pay any fees to receive payments.

However we know that high schoolers are engaged and inspired by education-focused creators like @chemicalkim, a chemistry educator who has over 1 Million followers on TikTok, so we want to build a place where these educators have all the tools necessary to inspire kids online. Edily is a mobile app combining the engagement of social platforms with focus and organization of educational platformws. We enable educators and students to be participants rather than passengers in the edtech ecosystem, helping them create educational videos that are fun in a TikTok-like format that appeals to the way kids want to be engaged. Our platform not only features creators and influencers, but also tags videos to curriculum, has discovery algorithms that emphasizes learning (not time spent online), has video creation tools that enable educators to build videos quickly and even earn money, and personalizes which of the many videos a student may learn from on a specific topic.",

At Tephra Labs, we believe that decentralized human networks have the potential to be the right meta-coordinating structures for these large-scale problems. These networks can engage diverse participants and grow to unprecedented sizes (hundreds of millions of people). Further, they do not rely on the same kind of centralized direction-setting that is characteristic of governments and companies – making them lower overhead organizational structures overall. Tephra Labs’ mission is to enable large-scale human coordination to address humanity’s most important challenges and opportunities. We aim to build the infrastructure to scale decentralized networks to billions of people, and to support network participants in leading consistent, purposeful, and fulfilling lives. Our hypothesis is that hyper-scale decentralized networks will grow by engaging people as independent workers, rather than employees. So, we are building the necessary products, tooling, and services to help independent workers thrive. Our first product is Radius ( ). Radius is a decentralized network that connects independent workers and teams to the best projects in web3. As part of the Radius project, we are building decentralized reputation systems, skills attestation protocols, and a user-owned and value accretive economy. In accordance with our mission, we will also build educational curricula and programs to help train Radius workers and onboard them successfully into web3 work opportunities. We are excited to build the necessary infrastructure to enable the first billion-person organizations in human history. If this mission also inspires you, consider joining us.",

We're doing this, first of all, by showcasing series and movies that are taking chances and wouldn't necessarily be distributed on other platforms because, while they're great ideas, they're unproven. Our audience wants unproven concepts and to be the first to discover them. We remove algorithms and instead let our audience directly decide on our content, which can often be described as artistic, edgy, experimental, fun, interactive, and, above all, not mainstream. We also doing this by imbuing Cideshow with crowdfunding and gamification. Viewers directly renew their favorite shows with virtual currency, and they are incentivized with rewards for doing so. Viewers can also ascend to higher statuses by watching/supporting/participating in shows, which unlock more privilegies and powers for them, making Cideshow the only gamified streaming service and an engaging, addictive experience. We created Cideshow in 2017, and we have been using that time to get a working prototype up. We now have this prototype up and running, and we're ready to make Cideshow everything it can be. With a lot more content on its way, we're about to enter the Angel/Seed round of funding to build out the content, the main site, and the marketing. Now that we're at this stage, we're looking to establish a solid team that can help bring Cideshow to its full potential. We are set on creating a more imaginative, fun, and active television experience for the world. We're looking for those who are inspired by this goal and who are ready to join us on the journey.

By making fish farming cheaper and more viable than livestock production, we aim to mitigate one of the biggest causes of climate change and help prepare our planet for impending population growth. Aquaculture is the single fastest growing food-production sector in the world, and now is the time to define how technology is used to harvest the ocean for generations to come. Through custom underwater cameras, computer vision, and machine learning we are able to quantify fish weights, detect sea lice infestations, and generate optimal feeding plans in real time. Our product operates at three levels: on-site hardware for image capture, cloud pipelines for data processing, and a user-facing web application. As a result, there are hundreds of moving pieces and no shortage of fascinating challenges across all levels of the stack. If interested, please apply at or email: jobs@aquabyte.ai",

We are re-authoring the aging narrative by enabling Americans to age with purpose and security and to define their best chapter. For most people, Medicare is boring, bureaucratic, and confusing. But choosing the right Medicare coverage is tremendously important — traditional Medicare leaves seniors responsible for at least 20% of medical costs and doesn't cover prescription drugs, dental, hearing, or vision care. And more than 10,000 coverage options exist nationwide, with each senior often facing 50+ options in their location alone.",

With properties in three cities (and many more coming!) we operate a platform that allows buildings to blur the line between hotels and apartments. Our platform is an all-in-one solution which includes property operations, customer acquisitions, and the tech stack to operate with more flexibility than any other company in the market. Our tech-enabled buildings create a one-of-a-kind guest experience and tremendous value in the underlying real estate. Whether a guest or resident is with us for three days or three years, these are more than just spaces to spend the night—they are a place to call home. Our property team members focus on bringing our business to life at each of our buildings with a focus on execution, and resident and guest experience. Our non-property team members focus on supporting property execution and the evolution of the other areas of the platform. The non-property roles are remote-first with the option to work out of our DC or SF offices. We think in-person collaboration and bonding is extremely important, so our remote-first team members participate in quarterly in-person retreats with their teams at various locations across the U.S.",

By replacing job boards with matching and automation, RippleMatch eliminates the most time-intensive parts of the recruitment process for both employers and job seekers. Leading employers such as Amazon, eBay, and Teach For America leverage RippleMatch to build diverse, high-performing teams and Gen Z job seekers across the country trust RippleMatch to launch and grow their careers. Since launching RippleMatch from a college dorm room in 2016, we've raised $34 million in venture funding, helped tens of thousands of users find jobs, expanded to 1,300+ colleges & universities, and brought on hundreds of leading employers as customers. Our tight-knit team of 100+ (& growing!) talented people work hard, celebrate wins, and care deeply about changing the way finding a job works.",

From one-person hobby projects to 800-person engineering juggernauts, we’re building the rock-solid tooling solution every team needs. Maintaining development velocity is impossible when you’re constantly babysitting pull requests. Putting your product roadmap on hold to triage a sick repo shouldn’t be a regular occurrence.

We found that users' key concerns were about what they would do with their transcription, the workflow behind the text file: for example, Journalists, Researchers and Video-Editors all use it in different ways. We decided to build something different: a multilingual and frictionless platform for transcription and subtitles through our machine-generated and human-made services.

I thought “what a waste of time, there's got to be a better way.” People spend so much time planning their days (and their lives) around the things that they own. The status quo when you land in a new city is to go straight to the airport just to drop your stuff off, even if it doesn’t make sense otherwise.

The business demands on web images can blindside even the most hyper-aware content teams and developers. Just to be competitive on the Internet, you need your images to be sized perfectly to every device, served in one of any of a half dozen web formats, optimized to the absolute best perceptual quality while maintaining pinpoint performance, and distributed to wherever your users are, anywhere in the world. And that is just the baseline. Next-level imaging concerns like copyright, licensing, accessibility, moderation, illegal or explicit content, \"fake news\", and more, can threaten your business at any moment if not handled properly. Get any of these things wrong and you are shedding revenue, ceding ground to competitors, and potentially exposing your business to extreme liability. By working with imgix's powerful APIs, SDKs, user interfaces, and integrations, you can rest assured that any demands on your images will always be met, now and into the future, without you having to invest in building it yourself or patching together a mishmash of open source and third-party technologies. Our platform is designed to ensure that your images are always working for your business and never against it. imgix is venture-backed, with about $11 million in investment, and was launched through the famed Y Combinator accelerator program.

Today, we are building tools and API's to that provide real-time visibility to people who help move containers and make the entire process a lot more efficient. 2015: We started building software for drayage tucking companies, helping them automate their dispatch operations and back office. 2016: Released a free container tracking tool for the Port of Oakland. Helping truckers and service providers track thousands of containers daily. 2017: We launched our own trucking service in the Port of Oakland with full visibility and collaborative tools for our trucking partners, our ops team and our customers through an online portal. 2019 & 2020: We lauched the all-in-one container tracking platform based on our learnings from our drayage customers in Oakland.

We’re doing that by making it easy for protocols to distribute their tokens to users. We believe that by helping protocols solve token distribution, we’ll not only make crypto protocols more sustainable, but also help anyone in the world earn income through provable contribution rather than their background or credentials. RabbitHole has created an efficient way for protocols to distribute tokens by segmenting users based on on-chain & off-chain data. By completing on-chain tasks in various protocols, users build their on-chain resume, and earn token ownership. What problem are we solving? Protocols are constantly looking for new ways to find and engage users, but don’t have an easy way to do so. Tokens of these protocols often fall in the hands of speculators who sit on centralized exchanges, rather than users of these networks. On the other hand, new users in crypto have a difficult time in knowing where to start on their crypto journey and don’t know who to trust. Why are we solving this problem? By making it more efficient for protocols to distribute their token to network participants, we are both driving more participation to protocols and making it easier for users to increase their ownership in protocols rather than speculators. By increasing the number of token holders who are using the network, we are making the underlying protocol more sustainable, and putting more money in the pockets of users. Why are we different? RabbitHole is a group of crypto-natives who have years of experience in crypto. Compared to other crypto projects, we’re not building another Metaverse or protocol for risk — we’re focused on helping serve existing decentralized protocols and get their tokens in the hands of the right token holders. We believe in the potential of what crypto stands for and can become, but we know that today there’s a lot to improve.",

    "about": "Going through tons of graphs, charts, and dashboards is very cumbersome and painful for business owners. That's why they are adopting the Enterprise Metaverse in the form of Digital twins. From a survey conducted by Gartner, 75% of businesses want to implement digital twins, but only 13% have implemented it so far; the other 62% have it on their roadmap but find it hard or don't have the direct skill set in the team to implement it. After all, it's not a simple task to create a working, scalable, and living virtual replica of your factories in 3D. It's really complicated, requires a specialized 3D development team and specialized engineers to do the job; thus out of the reach of many businesses. This is where we step in to bridge the gap by bringing the capabilities of NoCode into a 3D workspace that allows businesses to build 3D apps without writing any code or having to depend on a 3D team. Our product, Cloudworx Studio, is a web-based IDE that lets users build applications and workflows for 3D content without writing any code. Our current focus is to build applications for the Enterprise Metaverse in the form of digital twins that are powered by real-time data from sensors, equipment, processes, and interactions. Using Cloudworx Studio, users can import their 3D models, create animations, interactions, workflows and alerts on them; and link them with real-time IoT sensors data to build digital twins in a no-code fashion.",

Since tokens are now getting staked, they are removed from the trading supply giving startups breathing space to focus on other aspects. The gamification framework on UniFarm ensures that if few users are staking, the APY is very high (250% to 350%), encouraging investors to stake more tokens, thereby creating a demand for it.

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features: Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections. Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals. Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes. WalletHub’s initial focus was in the credit card space, and we quickly became the go-to credit card resource for consumers and industry professionals alike. Not only did the nonprofit group Consumer Action rate WalletHub as the best credit card website, but our industry research and expert opinions are featured in the national media far more often than any other company in the space. In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.",

As Northvolt's Advanced Technology Center operating in Silicon Valley, Cuberg is developing and commercializing lithium metal batteries, building an innovation ecosystem around lithium-ion technology, and leveraging Northvolt's state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities to rapidly scale up production of advanced batteries. Cuberg's groundbreaking lithium metal battery delivers generational improvements in energy density and power output and was validated by the U.S. Department of Energy in 2020. The company's battery products are ideally suited to power the next generation of electric vehicles on the ground and in the air, offering longer ranges and flight times, greater payloads, and lower cost of ownership. The technology, based on a non-flammable liquid electrolyte combined with a lithium metal anode, is fully compatible with existing lithium-ion manufacturing infrastructure to accelerate time-to-market. Cuberg spun out of the materials science department at Stanford University in 2016 and received seed funding from Boeing HorizonX Ventures as well as grants from Activate.org, the California Energy Commission, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. National Science Foundation, CalSEED, and others.

Sericin’s platform allows them to standardize leasing transactions and capture the data that drive asset value. Sericin’s Document Studio is structured around leasing workflows: leasing teams generate standard contracts from best-in-class leasing precedents within ease by inputting core leasing terms, with all other data populated as per standard policy. Users may amend deal terms on platform and receive expert legal and valuation tooltips, including alternative negotiation positions, educating their decisions. A ‘traffic lights’ system alerts users to internal policy and deviations trigger approval flows. Because Sericin’s platform captures all leasing data at source our ‘Valuation Genie’ provides real-time valuation impacts of individual as well as complex sets of decisions. Through this structured process Sericin supports leasing teams in their decisions to flexibly capture maximum value without introducing unmanageable risk, while always observing their organization’s policies. Ultimately, such smoother negotiations allow landlords to attract and retain better tenants and capitalize on improved relationships. Underpinning all, is the fully automated capture of all legal and commercial data that determine risk and value. Because leasing data is collected throughout the leasing lifecycle, from inception to termination, it is industry-wide the most granular leasing data set, that allows Sericin to close the loop on fractured tenant acquisition and leasing data stitched together from CRMs, marketplaces, property management and analytics platforms.",

Our innovative features bring life back into mobile-dating, creating a fresh, fun, and comprehensive experience that you'll love! Dating apps have become increasingly dissatisfying to their audience. The average user has 3-4 different apps downloaded on their phone, none of which fulfill their needs. This is because these apps are all built off the same feature-foundation… just rehashing and rebranding to offer the same basic experience. Simply put, the mobile-dating industry has lost it's innovation, creativity, and vision. Finally, a new and better experience is here, with Tap! Our TWO revolutionary features create an app unlike any other on the market. NEARBY MATCHING Approaching someone new isn’t always easy. Every day we come across interesting people that catch our eye, wishing we could somehow connect. But too often these passing glances become missed opportunities. Until now... Nearby Matching is a core feature of Tap! which uses Bluetooth to connect you with others within eyesight in real-time. But we didn't stop there... OPEN DATE Dating apps have this exhausting process of: 1. swiping through hundreds of profiles 2. getting a match (if you’re lucky) 3. initiating conversation 4. facing patchy messaging 5. and ultimately (hopefully) meeting someone While VERY few matches (less than 2%) ever lead to an actual date. With Open Date, skip the hassle! First, schedule an event directly on Tap! to look for potential dates. Then view a list of users who are free at the same time & place as you. All that's left is to match with the one you like and you’re all set for your new date!",

And, it makes a difference for our communities. Our advisor, Hal Varian, developed an economic theory that is the bedrock of our model. His theory says if we know what a customer has done historically, and we know what that customer needs right now, we can design a personalized offering that maximizes the customer’s purchasing power, the merchant’s profitability, & societal value overall. At Upside, we do just that. We use real data to understand user behavior and generate personalized cash-back offers to motivate customers to buy more, more often--for millions of users and thousands of businesses across the country.",

Just like you, we were a growing organization that needed a people platform to scale our services business. We evaluated every software in the market and were frustrated after reviewing all of them. Thus, we started Keka. The goal was simple. Automate and simplify people processes so you can focus on your core asset - the employees. They, in turn, will transform you from a good to a great organization! THE PRESENT - VINI. VIDI. VICI. We came. We saw. We disrupted. Keka has been a silent revolution in the making from our launch four years ago. Our steadfast focus on building an employee-centric HR platform was well received by more than 5400 businesses across India and the world. Today we are India’s #1 platform in the segment with the most number of new customers adopting the platform. All with zero advertising spend and pure customer love.",

    "about": "It is hard to know what information you can trust these days. At Borg, we are working on solving this problem. To do that, we have developed a novel algorithm that enables the surfacing of high-quality information. We are now indexing social media and beyond, starting with Twitter. Existing search engines are content-centric. Their indexes are built around indexing connections between content and assigning them authority scores for particular topics. When humans evaluate how credible information is, we are author-centric -– we want to know how credible the person who created the content is. At Borg, we are building technology that will enable us to index the internet with this approach in mind. The next Google is not going to look like Google. Borg will not be a website where you type in a query. It is going to live in your WhatsApp, in your Siri, and in other products that you already use. It will be a combination of your personal “brain firewall” and a genius assistant with access to all of humanity’s knowledge and who understands you like a sibling. It is going to take many years to build Borg. We are going step by step. We have created two products. The first is Borg.api, which gives developers access to our index of tens of millions of social media accounts to infuse social intelligence into their apps without needing to index social media. The second is Hive.one, a powerful explorer for Twitter communities and relationships. At Borg, we do cutting-edge R&D and turn it into products. We are tackling some of the hardest problems in data science, building infrastructure to handle gigantic amounts of data, and innovating on novel user interfaces. You will love it here if you want a meaningful cause and a challenge.",

BUT, the tools that these day traders use to trade are nascent, inefficient, and costly. How do we help? We’ve built similar tools for institutions like hedge funds and HFT firms before. Our tools are 10x more powerful, and cost a fraction of what retailers currently pay. Our first tool, a free options backtester with a no-code interface, now comes with a Live Execution Engine.

    "about": "Dipsea is a female-founded company empowering women to tap into their sexuality on their own terms, and to feel more powerful in and outside the bedroom. Our in-house story studio produces original erotic audio stories, sexual wellness sessions, and sleep scenes. While new startup players have addressed female pleasure with hardware products and better education, the content landscape hasn’t seen meaningful change. By taking a mind-first approach to sexuality, Dipsea is pioneering what The New Yorker calls “a new genre of storytelling” Founded in 2017 and backed by world class investors like Thrive (Spotify, Instagram) and Bedrock (The Athletic, Cameo), Dipsea is pushing the conversation around sex out of vice and into wellness. In just two years our team of engineers and creators has built three apps, produced over 250 audio stories, successfully navigated complex policy and advertising challenges, and created a product listeners love. Curious what people are saying? “It has allowed me to explore my fantasies without shame and make my sexual wellness not just permissible but a priority. It's amazing that an app can be that transformational, but it is.” \"Amazing writing, gorgeous sound design, wonderful actors. I really really appreciate how much attention you all give to lgbtq+ experiences and alternative lifestyles as well.\" \"Although I’ve had the same partner for the last 13 years, I’ve always struggled with how to ask for what I want. Dipsea provided positive examples of functional communication in the bedroom. This allowed me to shift the way I communicate with my partner, and I feel more satisfied and empowered than I ever have before in my life.” \"I'm a survivor of sexual assault, so it's really helpful to have an audio story of fully consenting adults to kinda, help me re-normalize how sex can be a joyful, positive experience. It's been helpful for a little reprogramming.\" “Life changing. Self care is self love! This app will transport you.”",

Saarthi was recognized as one of the Top 20 Conversational AI Vendors globally, and also incubated by NVIDIA AI. Our platform, composed of many core patents, creates AI Agents in 24 languages and provides Conversation Analytics, from speech and text data lying unharnessed in contact centers. Saarthi's AI framework enables semantically rich and coherent dialogues, built on top of a lossless language understanding engine for low resource languages. This sector is ripe for disruption, with apparent problems of continuity, expenses and quality of contact centers. 19% Contact Centers have human bilingual support while 52% think that the Non-English queries will rise over the next 3 years. Saarthi.ai has broken many new grounds in Conversational AI over the past 3 years, to build the responsive and aware 'interaction layer' of the future, for every service imaginable. And, we believe our story will be interesting to you. Please feel free to drop us a note at hello@saarthi.ai / sangram.sabat@saarthi.ai, and we'll be thrilled to have a conversation.",

Our company and our team are growing fast. In 2017 we were just two college students at Loyola Marymount University nerding out on AI and the possibility of solving LA’s traffic problems. Now, we’re a team of 15 who have developed first-of-its-kind computer vision technology that’s supporting the nation’s very first zero-emissions delivery zones and helping multiple cities and airports across the country tackle congestion and reduce emissions. But we have huge goals and the growth we plan to achieve in the coming year requires a much bigger team. We want to build the blueprint for how cities all over the country and around the world use computer vision to make their streets more livable, but we can’t do it without more people equally inspired by transformative technology and the possibility of making our communities safer, healthier, and more sustainable. We’re diverse, passionate about new ideas, work hard, prioritize work-life balance, and never take ourselves too seriously. Join us!",

Our first set of clients are life insurance companies: Acquisition economics in life insurance are painfully wasteful: 70% of their total cost is spent on acquiring new policyholders. Our products help them acquire high-quality leads at the lowest cost, dramatically improving their acquisition economics. Huge TAM: The top 10 US life insurance companies spend ~$6B each per year on customer acquisition (marketing awareness, lead generation, and sales conversion). They rely on traditional channels (TV, stadium sponsorships, google/Facebook ads) that are experiencing a decline in effectiveness as they are not focused on finding health-conscious consumers. Insurance companies know they need to innovate and find alternatives to these undifferentiated advertisements, and are looking for insurtech technologies and services to help with their ability to engage their most valuable leads more cost-effectively. How: Optimity helps insurance companies attract healthy customers, and keep them healthy, happy and engaged in a useful way to increase their lifetime value. Moat: The scale of our user base is exploding (we have over 1.3M users with verified emails). We are gathering a rich and unique set of longitudinal data on consumers and are training ML models with this data to uncover propositions for our customers to sell more insurance, virally generate leads, and advance underwriting.",

Our main customers are local governments, infrastructure owners and transport providers. Real-time data from a network of video feeds enable them to react to demand, improve safety and improve the utilisation of their assets; and prediction gives them the foresight to pre-empt problems in their network, rather than simply reacting. Our systems use the latest machine learning and computer vision techniques, run on bespoke, low-cost, easy-to-install hardware. All the edge intelligence is in the software, enabling remote updating and reducing hardware obsolescence and cost.",

We’re building a platform called EatQ (www.eatq.io), empowering food brands to take control of their data and get discovered. The consumer app is still available, just not our focus. Did you know that 84% of food brands fail to claim the attributes they qualify for and that consumers search for?? We’re going to help food manufacturers get discovered; especially those emerging food brands focused on health & sustainability. At Eatiquette our north star is total transparency and traceability from the producer to the consumer for food products (from farm to fork).

Foodi has taken this growing trend, and further improved the experience for patrons, waitstaff, and restaurant owners by creating a seamless, safe, and simple ordering experience. Currently, physical menus are limited to brief descriptions of meals with few visuals, not to mention the increased risk of spreading COVID-19. While PDFs and web-hosted options reduce the use of high-touch areas, they can be more difficult to navigate than traditional menus, and can be confusing for those who are less tech savvy. Foodi solves all these issues by reimagining the restaurant experience. With our menu design platform restaurants can design intuitive, visually pleasing, mobile menus without the need for a programmer or graphic design expert, then print off associated QR codes or embed their menu on their website. In-menu payments coming soon!",

That's $400 billion of rent changing hands every year. And yet renting is tedious. We are making renting digital... We make it simple for owners to share their property details as a custom webpage, respond to bookings online, and accept digital payments easily. We are digitizing the tenant joining process. Digital KYC saves everyone's time of physically visiting the police station, lawyer, or notary to sign documents. We help owners collect their rent and bill dues on time by sending automatic reminders, tracking the late payees, and rewarding tenants who pay on time. How we started? What have we achieved? Being unhappy tenants in their school & college life, Srijan, Nimit & Manish built a 2 Cr/200 beds PG business while in college. Seeing the struggles of untimely rent collection, and inefficient rental processes, they launched an MVP in June 2019.

The prefix \"anti-\" in the Greek etymology implies \"instead of\" rather than the American tongue (\"against\"). So, instead of artificial intelligence, Hexagon Lavish® has developed technology known as \"informational interpretation\" (not to be confused with the convoluted \"information interpretation\" associated with the \"quantum\" orientation of physics). PIR: Premier Information Retrieval exemplifies informational interpretation as a technology designed to perform immediate detection of potential harmful substances in from a consumer's convenient of their very own smartphone .

Volta is in the proximity of Kendall Square, known as \"the most innovative square mile on the planet\". Being part of the open biotech culture in Kendall Square made us realize that today’s biologists are held back by the limitations of existing automation tools. With DNA sequencing in particular, we observed that the advances in DNA readout technologies had moved further along than the advances in the upstream steps of preparing samples for sequencing (sample prep). ‍ What started out as a simple printed circuit board to manipulate colored droplets at the MIT Media Lab during co-founder Udayan Umapathi’s graduate work was quickly directed toward solving the “sample prep bottleneck”. The company raised Seed Funding from top VCs in 2019 and later that year added Will Langford as a co-founder and Head of Engineering. ‍ Since then, we have been heads down in the lab inventing and building novel fluidic and sample manipulation technologies. We take an anti-disciplinary approach to solve very hard problems and weave together instrumentation, fluidics, software, biology and chemistry. While our current focus is on sequencing sample prep, we envision a new approach where a single universal machine automates most biological workflows in genomics, proteomics and synthetic biology.",

The building blocks to a good match between people and a role are ‘soft skills’ - a person’s culture alignment, strengths & gaps, and career interests. We specialize in measuring these soft skills, which we call Behavioral data. This data is very hard to get in a typical resume and interview based hiring process.

Growth for today’s highest performing SaaS business is no longer sales-led, but driven by a self-serve, product-led motion. In this new world, companies have an abundance of data about their customers - including firmographic data (industry, geography, company size, title) and product usage data (who signed up, how many teammates they invited, what features are used, who the product champions are). But, this data lives in multiple different places - the data warehouse, CRM, marketing tools, and more - and the sales teams don't have the tools to access and analyze this data to inform their sales strategy. Simply put, the traditional enterprise sales tech stack is broken. Sales teams spend an overwhelming amount of time digging through data and switching between various tools to do their job. Pocus was founded to make data actionable for sales teams so they can work smarter. With Pocus, sales teams can focus on adding value to their customers, instead of digging through data. As the first ever platform to combine product engagement data with customer demographic data, we are giving sales reps access to insights that have never been available before. With this unique data, we enable sales teams to convert free / self-serve users to large paid customer contracts more efficiently and effectively. Through analytics and automations, Pocus identifies top opportunities / power users, alerts sales reps of product usage changes, and recommends the next best action so that sales teams can close bigger deals faster.",

Our platform helps people digitally locate their old 401k and transfer it seamlessly into a new account at any financial institution – without the paperwork, phone calls, and faxes of the past. In doing so, we’re automating the process by which $500 billion in 401k assets is rolled over each year. We’re also making sure that the 15 million 401k account holders who change jobs annually don’t do the wrong thing with their assets – like cash them out, leave them behind, or pay excessive fees that erode their savings over time. But that’s not where we’re stopping. We believe all Americans should retire with enough money for a life of dignity. Over time, we intend to eliminate all of the friction in the retirement savings system that stops them from doing so. We’re a well-funded, early stage company backed by leading venture capital investors in New York (Greycroft, RRE), the Bay Area (Bling Capital) and Los Angeles (Walkabout).",

And each city has it's own transportation stack: you move around SF differently than you move around London, Munich or Oslo. Each one of those different transportation options in each city are on completely different technology stacks with different ticket redemption choices. Very often their fare structures are arcane, making you choose between \"Tariff AB, BC or ABC.\" Mozio seeks to plug into all these sources and build your ultimate city mobility solution: we want you to be able to book a Supershuttle in Dallas, the Heathrow Express train in London, the U-Bahn in Germany, and Lyft when you get back home to SF.",

Six years ago we started by solving the inherent, unnecessary hassle tied to birth control. We built a new system, because the current one failed us. By creating an accessible, affordable, and convenient experience, we’ve served more than two million patients nationwide and counting. Women and people who menstruate have long been dismissed, talked over and often ignored by health providers. At Favor, we know this because many of us have lived it. We’re evolving from a single-point solution focused on birth control delivery & reproductive healthcare to a digital health platform that offers prescription skin care, over-the-counter skin care, period care, and other sexual wellness items. We accept most major forms of insurance, Medicaid in select states, and offer affordable out-of-pocket options too. Favor is the place to go when you want to get treated right.",

To help organizations “make it real,” we convene multidisciplinary stakeholders, facilitate alignment among partners, map ecosystems, create frameworks for thoughtful and considered decision-making, build scenarios around opportunity areas, select pathways, design strategic programs — and ultimately, operationalize and launch new initiatives. When the bets are big and the stakes are high, our clients come to us for rapid alignment, smart strategies, and agile execution. We deliberately design pilots and incentive programs for both short-term and long-term ambitions. When Osso VR won the EdSim Challenge, it was a newly established company. Since then, the company has deployed its solution in more than 20 global hospital residency programs and now employs over 100 people. Last year, the winner of the Opioid Detection Challenge was awarded a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) contract to conduct the first phase of a pilot program; its advanced threat algorithms detect narcotics and opioids that are shipped and concealed in mail and other packages. And the results of MagQuest will inform the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s acquisition strategy for a World Magnetic Model data collection capability, with an expected procurement that can provide operational capacity by 2027.

Who We AreThe Time Doctor team is fully remote team made up of more than 130 people in 30+ countries.Since we first launched in 2012, our goal has been to empower people to work productively no matter where they are. We all work from home and love having the freedom to choose when and where we want to work while being able to spend more time with our families or travelling. Remote Business Is the FutureThere has been an evolution in the workplace over the last few years. Remote work has stopped being simply the cheap option for companies and has started becoming the right option, not just to reduce costs, but also to hire the best talent. A growing number of companies are choosing to be distributed instead of in-person and even without physical offices are growing to valuations of more than a billion dollars. At Time Doctor, our focus is on allowing customers to build distributed teams that can work wherever and whenever they want, so the business can focus on allocating their office-running costs elsewhere. We have seen a huge amount of growth in the remote work sector over the past few years and are proud to be one of the first remote employee management applications.

We’re unifying DevOps from the other side – starting from the actual workflows and then solving backwards to the enabling data and technologies to make DevOps faster, easier, and safer. Early users of our software have said it’s “orders of magnitude better” than what’s on the market right now, and “solves a problem that every DevOps engineer faces”. Our founder is coming off a 9-figure acquisition (just four years post-founding) with his last company. Our team hails from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and the fastest-growing tech companies in history. We hold dozens of patents in machine learning and have published academic papers in computational modeling as well as human-computer interaction.

Empower’s software also enables riders to request a favorite or same gender driver so that they feel safe. Empower is revolutionizing the transportation industry.

Empower provides the information and tools that drivers need to take control of their financial future and the choices that riders need to safely and affordably get from point A to point B. With Empower, both drivers and riders win.

Our mission is to partner with businesses and insurers so they can deliver seamless insurance experiences, lower their costs and keep their customers safe.

Yet, shockingly little services exist to help the unemployed. The assumption is that startups cannot help the unemployed - it's the realm of the public and non-profit sector. Our customers disagree. We believe the world needs Claimyr, it won’t happen any time soon if we don’t do it, and we are much less likely to succeed if you don’t join. Claimyr takes the claim process from weeks and months to minutes or days. We automate communication channels with state unemployment agencies through custom telecom APIs. We also give unemployed people access to a quickly growing network of others to crowdsource problems, Q&A, and other critical support. We have helped 100,000 people receive more than $700,000,000 in benefits. We are a profitable bootstrapped company and growing faster than we can handle.",

We occupy the space that exists between OnlyFans and Instagram/TikTok, giving a previously unserved group of creators a way to monetize their content and connect with their audiences more intimately. We started this company because existing monetization products are either too restrictive or too stigmatized. A growing group of women and non-binary creators didn’t have a safe, credible, and progressive space to directly monetize their audiences. And until Sunroom, these creators were missing out on this income stream. Sunroom users say that the safety features, respectful conversations, authentic content, and high-touch support is what sets the platform apart. Sunroom was founded by women who were leaders at Hinge and Bumble. We have a small but talented LA based team, who care deeply about the safety of our creators, how much money they're earning, and changing the perceptions people have towards women monetizing themselves online. We're backed by several top women angel investors, including Whitney Wolfe Herd, Cyan Bannister, and Li Jin, as well as funds like Blackbird and Red Swan.

India is expected to rise from 400 million internet users to about 800 million users. Most of whom will be with vernacular preferences. Unfortunately there's a dearth of content to cater to these users in a largely English dominated internet. If they search for basic questions / queries on Google, they get irrelevant search results. Most of their search queries are in voice but the search results are web links - something many aren't used to. These vernacular internet users don't enjoy the same level of information and knowledge that english internet users do. Vokal bridges that gap by giving vernacular Indians the easiest way to ask questions using voice. These questions are then answered by subject matter experts in voice or video, in their native language. Vokal is a small team of 30 people that's poised to cater to 250+ million monthly users in the next few years thanks to the ever-growing network of contributors that create more vernacular content on the internet everyday than anyone else on the planet!",

    "about": "Because is a female founded?, VC-backed ecommerce enablement startup that started in Boston and is growing in Tampa?. We just raised our $3M Seed Round led by Harlem Capital and some other awesome investors like 2 Lanterns Ventures, the Chief Talent Officer at Shopify, first 10 operator from Uber, former VP Marketing from Gillette, Launchpad Venture Angel Group, BOSS Syndicate, Service Provider Capital, and more. Now that we’re entering the next phase of growth for Because, we're looking for some awesome folks to join us and grow to the next stage. Now what does Because Intelligence do? We’re an ecommerce enablement software platform built on top of Shopify that helps small online merchants grow their add to cart rate by up to 38%. We help them do this by integrating their back end data into their front end site experience to drive the most accurate and up to date content for their site visitors. All built for the non-technical marketer- no developer required. Our automation platform merges the front end of ecommerce website design with a store’s back end data infrastructure (ecommerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce + merchant tools like Shippo and Yotpo) to provide for a fully automated experience. No more out of date delivery info. No more questions about whether or not it’s in stock. No more concerns about shipping costs. And definitely no more lost trust from missing reviews or product details. Now it’s all managed in one place by Because. Data + Content brought peacefully together.?",

    "about": "Metabolic disease caused by insulin resistance is responsible for millions of deaths by diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and more. The latest CDC estimates that there are over 100 million people in the US who are type 2 diabetic, or pre-diabetic. Most of these cases are preventable and reversible through what the medical industry is calling lifestyle medicine—prescribed lifestyle changes which improve medical outcomes. After our CEO saw the power of lifestyle medicine first-hand, we decided to build Blueberry an application which helps people reverse their metabolic disease through key lifestyle changes. There's over 50 years of solid science in the field which supports our protocol, and our challenge is to solve the adherence problem. Our mission is to reverse 1 million cases of metabolic disease by 2025. If you're passionate about health, saving lives, and doing work that truly matters, then we encourage you to join Blueberry.",

    "about": "Almost everyone who will buy a solar plant in the 21st century has never bought one before. An average user does not have the past experience, the technical know how or even the financial support required to make this once in a lifetime purchase. Once the purchase has been made, this lack of experience and know how makes it difficult for the user to then get the maximum value out of their power plant. SafEarth has been built to bridge this gap. We operate an online platform that digitises the entire lifecycle of a solar plant - allowing users to get the best possible value out of their shift to clean energy. Our platform hand holds a user through the procurement, installation and maintenance phases of a solar project. This allows a user to get the highest possible return on investment from these assets while reducing the challenges and hassles faced by users. Our users are also able to raise low cost finance for their projects on our platform. Till date (May 2021), SafEarth platform has completed nearly 40MWs of solar projects for industries around the country. Today, these plants are saving nearly 70,000 Tonnes of Carbon emissions every year and saving our customers over Rs 12cr. in annual electricity expenditures.",

RacerX has solved this problem by creating the Snap4that app. Snap4that replaces the pile of paper that accompanies these products (owners guides, setup guides, warranty cards, parts & accessories catalogs) with a simple app. All the consumer needs to do is to download the app and use it to scan a barcode included with the product. The consumer benefits by getting a better ownership experience by having up-to-date multimedia content where they need it, when they need it with no need to search a junk drawer or on google.

This process occurs naturally, however, it takes 100 years to saturate, and we reduce it to 100 hours. C4C’s technology locks down the CO2 in concrete permanently even after demolition of buildings.

Because tech is great at parsing derived data, but has mostly ignored primary metrics.Because humankind deserves an internet organised and optimised for quality, not quantity. We are building now, for the decentralised, prosumer, human future.",

Over the past decade, there has been an explosion in demand for mental health services, and more specifically, mental health professionals. Yet despite this, mental health professionals are still vastly underserved. Mental health professionals operate like small-medium businesses (SMBs). But unlike other SMBs, they lack the tools and systems needed to understand the ins and outs of their business. Instead, they're forced to work with a disparate array of expensive services or contractors to manage their finances, their taxes, their payroll, their savings and more. Not only is this outside their area of expertise — every hour spent wrangling finances or filling out forms is one less hour spent providing care. By creating the financial back office for therapists, we empower them with the clarity needed to be a successful business, allowing them to better serve their clients. We're so excited to empower the therapists to do their best work. We hope you'll join us.",

This can be clearly seen in the example of private watchlists, whose non-public nature allows financial criminals to migrate between institutions even after being detected by one. To address this problem VeraDAT introduces VeraHIT - a collaborative platform that enables privacy-friendly data matching for financial institutions. VeraHIT enables financial institutions to access clients’ background information that before would have remained undetected due to fear of revealing its source or exposing sensitive data.

I have over 20+ years in cybersecurity and no longer am constrained by a non-compete, non-solicitation, or non-hire, so my entire network is open. We are building a stealth cybersecurity SaaS B2B product to compete in the GRC (Governance, Risk Management & Compliance) automation space. With digital transformation on the rise, the attack surface continues to broaden. Because everyone knows there is no such thing as 100% secure, businesses have to be able to tell their cybersecurity program \"story\", and make certain that their \"story\" is defensible. When you combine the $3.4T (yes trillion) digital transformation space with the problem of the cybersecurity talent shortage, the opportunity is immense, to say the least. In addition to this opportunity, the current incumbent products leave lots of room for improvement. While they battle to become the biggest unicorn, we intend to fly under the radar, building a better product and targeting clients we've been working with for years that are willing to pilot the MVP. Our intent is to exit within 3 to 5 years.",

Our community-based model of care combines expert coaching with a small group support system to empower expecting parents throughout pregnancy and beyond. June’s evidence-based curriculum is designed with leading experts and OBGYNs to drive health outcomes that can impact the lives of millions. The US has the worst maternal health outcomes and highest cost of care of any developed country, and we’re on a mission to change that. When families join June, they get paired with 5-7 other families in their June Circle. Our group matching algorithm is designed to drive connection and encourage peer-to-peer support, especially important in a time when families feel more isolated than ever. We’ve supported hundreds of families to date and have an NPS of 86, 10x better than the average NPS of a healthcare provider. We’ve made major traction in the healthcare ecosystem and have a growing relationship with a health system with access to 6.5M patients and conversations underway with payors. We’re excited to build a revolutionary digital platform for maternal health just as Noom, Omada, and Livongo built digital tools for weight loss, diabetes, and behavior change. June’s platform will democratize access to high-quality maternal care for all, leading to better health outcomes across all demographics.",

With this step, Kubecost gives users a single view into both Kubernetes and “out of cluster” spending on cloud resources. “Kubecost’s new unified cost view allows users to see the complete picture, combining in-cluster spend on nodes, disks, and more with out-of-cluster spend on external services like AWS S3 and RDS,” said Webb Brown, CEO and co-founder of Stackwatch. “For the first time, engineering, finance, and leadership can get complete visibility across their infrastructure in less than five minutes.”",

These silos lead to a wasteful food system - a driver of climate change. Choco's here to provide the technology required for a connected, wasteless, data-driven, and innovative food system. We’re here to lead a change in one of the oldest industries on the planet, not just take part in it. We’re here to shape, not to observe. The problem we’re solving is complex with many moving parts, the work we’re doing is difficult and ambitious. But we’re here to win. That’s why we need the absolute best people to help us get there. Choco was founded by serial entrepreneurs Daniel Khachab, Julian Hammer, and Grégoire Ambroselli. Since its founding in 2018, the company has grown rapidly and is now active in markets such as the U.S., Germany, France, Spain, Austria, and Belgium. In February 2022, the total value of goods traded through Choco exceeded $1.2 billion. In April of 2022, we gained another $111 million in Series B2 funding with a valuation of $1.2 billion - earning us unicorn status just a few years in.",

We aim to empower teams, large or small, to build fast, reliable, and dependable dynamic systems at scale. Developers shouldn't have to form an opinion on Alpine Linux vs. Ubuntu or have the slightest idea how to configure Kafka. We believe with the right abstractions, it's possible to develop sophisticated apps entirely on your laptop, deploy them seamlessly on managed backends, and head out to dinner—confident your application will run identically in production at scale. No DevOps. This is the fulfillment of the exciting new serverless movement, and we're going to make it happen. Our team includes Principal Engineers and Engineering Directors who have led exabyte-scale storage projects, built custom global databases with trillions of records, and shipped desktop and mobile software onto billions of devices. All of us have deep experience with managing critical shared user state in large, successful services. Now, together at Convex, we've reflected on those collective lessons, and we have asked, listened, and learned about the needs of modern web and mobile teams. We've started to create something we believe is an entirely new and substantially better platform for teams of the future. We're eager to create the solution we wished we'd had for all those tricky frontend and backend problems we've wrestled to the ground over the years. We're motivated by the prospect of a new wave of teams using Convex and excited to empower them to solve challenges that only recently were quite daunting.",

    "about": "We are in the midst of a massive shift in how we write software, from human-driven to data-driven. Data-driven software, or software 2.0, will allow us to realize the true benefits of intelligent robots through deep learning, continual learning, and #reinforcement learning approaches. However, to fully realize these benefits we need a ground up reimagining of computer hardware to make them data & AI centric, and deliver super-computer level performance in the power envelope of the edge. At Lemurian Labs our purpose is to create better hardware and systems using a software-first approach that enables roboticists and ML engineers to do more, to free them from their computational burdens, and make it easier to get models into production so that society can benefit from more capable & intelligent robots sooner. We are developing the SPU (Spatial Processing Unit), an affordable AI inference accelerator uniquely designed from the ground up to deliver unprecedented performance/watt (up to 20X that of a GPU) and enable the next generation of AI workloads at the edge, ranging from autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, industrial robots, healthcare robots, search and rescue robots, to space robots. The SPU utilizes our patent pending novel arithmetic to speed up matrix-vector computations - which are core to modern day AI - beyond the capabilities of ordinary fixed point cores. Our diverse team of technologists have decades of experience at the frontiers of asic design, high performance computing, digital arithmetic, cryptography, artificial intelligence, robotics, and networking. If you want to be a part of bringing the powers of deep learning to the masses, join us. We look forward to hearing from you soon! :)",

To achieve this, we are building an app at the nexus of psychology, personalization, and engaging digital product design. Our team has a deeply personal relationship with mental health. Pair this with the lack of successful digital self-management tools publicly available, and we are determined to create something meaningful that would improve the lives of millions struggling with ADHD. We're eager to show the world that, when successfully managed, ADHD is not a hindrance, but instead a potential asset to professional and creative environments. We want to transform the narrative from self-doubt to self-empowerment, tackling the stigma behind ADHD. The following values steer every step of how we build our products, engage with the ADHD community, and grow our team of ADHD experts: • Education Over Medication: Help people understand their disorder and teach skills that cause lasting change, with or without medication. • Challenge The Status Quo: Find ways to make it better, cheaper, more fun, and accessible, despite what the industry is doing or telling us to do. • Break Financial Barriers: Provide solutions that are affordable and relevant for people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. • Your Data, Not Ours: While data is necessary to provide relevant services, we provide people with the ability to easily govern their private information. • Work Can Be Fun: We enjoy building products, strategies, and relationships, and believe joy comes from the journey. • Embrace Diversity: We believe diverse perspectives lead to better products and yearn for diversity of all kinds. After all, neurodiversity is core to our mission!",

    "about": "think-cell is the leading developer of graphics software to improve professional slide production in Microsoft PowerPoint. Our software automates the creation of charts and layouts to make working with PowerPoint easier, faster, and more enjoyable. More than 750,000 users worldwide at 15,000 companies rely on our software for their daily business, because it allows them to produce perfectly placed great-looking charts within minutes. Among our customers are not only 8 of the top 10 consulting companies, but also 65 of the top 100 US blue chip companies and 9 of the top 10 business schools. Without the think-cell software, creating slides in Microsoft PowerPoint is painstaking. Frequently used chart types and graphical elements are missing and there is nearly no automatic placement. Usually, you end up manually updating numbers and pushing around shapes. think-cell puts an end to this. While users comfortably work in your familiar PowerPoint environment it brings them 40+ chart types like Waterfall, Gantt, Marimekkos and Agenda. It also comes with dozens of data-driven visual enhancements and other unique features. Meanwhile, our software is smoothly integrated within the PowerPoint ribbon and 100% compatible. Charts created with our software and shared with pure PowerPoint users remain data-driven and changeable as if they had been created with standard PowerPoint. And it saves time: A study with one of the leading consulting firms proved that using the think-cell software saves you 70% of your net working time. \"Thank you, think-cell, for sponsoring the Standard C++ Foundation and challenging our Microsoft compiler team with complex C++ code\"​, says Herb Sutter, President of the Standard C++ Foundation. think-cell is based in the heart of Germany’s capital, Berlin. Computer Science PhDs Markus Hannebauer and Arno Schödl founded the company in 2002 and are still managing it today.",

Empty units cost them a TON of money. Enter: Smart City Locating. Our job as an apartment locating service is to help clients find the perfect place to live. Properties pay locators a commission out of their marketing budget for referring renters their way. We need an income, clients need a place to live, and properties need tenants. It’s a win-win-win! What is an Apartment Locator? An apartment locator is a licensed real estate agent that specializes in finding apartments for renters. Renting is a quicker process than buying and a renter will likely ask for help finding their next place when their lease ends. This pipeline-building process is a great first step into residential real estate— Smart City provides the opportunity to build your client network, to be ready when your renter is ready to buy a home. How It All Started:Smart City started in 2013 as a small apartment locating service in Dallas, Texas. In the early days, our founder and CEO Cassie Brown just wanted to help her friends find great places to live, but her innate drive to offer an amazing client experience quickly set Smart City apart from the competition. Since then, Smart City has taken big strides to disrupt the real estate industry by becoming a trusted and preferred partner for property management companies. We've cultivated a highly targeted lead generation engine that generates qualified rental leads to our team of licensed real estate agents across eight markets. Our agents put clients' needs first, delivering a personalized list of apartments to bring highly-interested and qualified traffic through the doors of our property partners. We are growing and looking for more agents to join our team to launch their real estate careers and grow their client-base into residential real estate.",

There is also a Web3 e-commerce store, like Amazon, and implementing crypto purchases that allow users to buy different products from books, electronics, clothing to footwear using their crypto all the payment is done on the blockchain which allows users not just to use their cryptos for investment but also to buy different products with it that will in return increase the usability of cryptocurrency globally as a currency to buy sell goods. We've also introduced NFTs, as well as a marketplace where they can create and sell NFTs that aren't available on any other social networking sites. There will also be a flurry of blockchain-based games in which players may earn crypto and NFTS just by playing. As a result of these steps, our platform's engagement will increase, distinguishing us from other web2 social media sites. In Vennverse, users have more authority and autonomy Because conventional social platforms place a premium on generating revenue, they have complete control over not just what users write, but also what they see. As a result, they show customers attention-getting advertising content, rather than educating them. Users on Vennverse, on the other hand, have complete freedom to link whatever they want because developers often just provide guiding parameters, leaving the rest to a distributed community of users.

The platform also helps businesses struggling with in-store sales gain more transactions by allowing them to register and track their deliveries in a similar fashion to what food delivery couriers do for restaurants. Though the majority of our Mates use their own vehicles for deliveries, we offer the resources to train first-timers on how to act independently and rent their vehicles and equipment. Mates are hired on a contractual basis and accept jobs based on their availability through MoveMate’s specialized Mate platform, which grants them significant work flexibility. MoveMate’s platform was launched in late April 2019 and has since helped over 380 customers in Montréal and generated close to $100K in revenue. By adapting our business model to serve changing needs amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a 600% growth rate between Q1 and Q2 of 2020If you want to learn more, become a mate or book your next move, come talk to us on Intercom.

DTonomy’s Assisted Incident Response platform (AIR) orchestrates hundreds of internal and external data sources and tools into a single platform, and leverages automation and artificial intelligence to enable analysts to triage all alarms and threats, not just the highest rated or most critical, without additional investment in resource. AIR’s unique adaptive learning engine continuously learns, provides contextual insights that are not easily discoverable, and makes relevant recommendations and automated workflows to guide IT teams through steps and procedures, resulting in up to 10 times quicker resolution of incidents, decreased downtime, and reduced alert fatigue for staff.",

    "employees": "11-50",
    "about": "Our mission is to help managers of shift workers with their daily HR needs. These managers struggle with internal and external staffing issues that are extremely costly to their businesses. So, as HR professionals ourselves, we decided to do something! Hyre is a comprehensive HR platform that helps businesses of all sizes, across different industries, manage their shift-based workforce by providing the tools that enable them to thrive, including employee shift scheduling, automated timesheets, digital time clocks, team messaging, and a built-in temp staffing pool. But how did we get here?? Well... Hyre started as a hospitality platform aimed at transforming how event organizers (hotels and event venues) staff their events. Traditionally, when event organizers are short-staffed (which is 30-50% of the time), they call a traditional staffing agency that charges them an arm and a leg for staff who are getting paid minimum wage. These agencies operate in a manual fashion that results in poor quality, high costs, and unreliability to the event organizers. This is just 1 example of how the hospitality world is currently riddled with mundane processes that cost end users billions in inefficiencies, time, and human error. By creating a platform that allowed hospitality professionals to take control of their own staffing, Hyre was able to reduce our clients' costs by a minimum of 50%! But we didn't want to stop there... So, we expanded into new verticles (internal scheduling software) and industries (healthcare, logistics, etc). **Who do we work with? We currently work with high-end clients such as the Hilton, Delta, Westin, Marriott, Ritz Carleton, Compass Group, Sodexo, Extendicare, etc., across Ontario. And... how big is this problem? HUGEOur temp-staffing solution is tackling a $300 Billion problem, our extended solution is tackling an additional $30 Billion problem. **We are building a suite of products that are taking on giants like ADP and Ceridian.",

Treejer's approach incentivizes not only forest plantation but also conservation by locking up the funds in a smart contract and releasing it over time as planters and other data providers continue providing updates from forest status. The protocol also provides proof-of-impact to donors in the form of dynamic tree NFTs that have real-world attributes. These NFTs are linked to each tree and are minted on Polygon network. Treejer protocol has several smart contracts and two main interfaces: a payment and forest tracking interface offered to donors on \" \" and a dedicated mobile app for tree planters and rural ambassadors. They use it to submit new trees, provide updates and unlock conservation rewards. Besides using official interfaces, builders can integrate the tree planting plugin with their existing products.",

To make Glyph, we source these molecules directly from plants and yeasts, rather than obtaining them through distilling and aging. By using the same building blocks as conventional distillers, we create fine spirits through a process we’ve developed called note-by-note production. Our process is different, but our commitment to quality rivals the best in the business. Each component is meticulously tested for purity.

While our differences make us adaptable and versatile, it’s our shared values that give us the strength and drive to become the cryptocurrency for world consciousness.” We see Bitcoin’s massive mining reward as overkill and believe Bitcoin could be about as secure with only a fraction of that mining reward (as seen by Bitcoin having great network security with no corresponding problems even when the market cap and mining reward was 1/10 as it is now). If Bitcoin had a system in place similar to Energi, Bitcoin would currently have BILLIONS OF DOLLARS worth per year to allocate to development and growth. This is an enormous missed value, a gap that Energi seeks to fill. Combining this with governance and smart contract capabilities is what we see as major features of the most powerful cryptocurrencies of the future.

Traditionally, the term Employee Health Benefits was synonymous with insurance / hospitalisation benefits only; ie, Secondary Care. Whereas today, 90% of individual healthcare and wellness related expenses in India are out of pocket on Primary Care; be it Mental Wellness, Fitness, Nutrition, Diagnostics, Medicines, and most of all, regular doctor appointments. The Covid-19 Pandemic has not only caused such expenses to increase multi fold, but also created a need for accessible systems. In a professional setting, such offerings are either lacking, or provided in an ad hoc, broken manner through various individual platforms. As a result, the experience for an employee is disconnected, with limited utilisation and engagement. This is where Visit Health comes in - a one stop solution for all employee health benefits needs. We help Companies build a Customized Wellness solution focused on Primary Care aspects such as Fitness, Mental Health, Doctor Teleconsultation, OPD programs, etc. for employees and their families, thereby reducing out of pocket expenses and creating healthier workforces. We have stitched up the broken pieces of employee health benefits in India to make one streamlined platform while increasing employee engagement through gamification. Visit Health has raised in total of $9million & is backed by renowned investors such as PolicyBazaar, Twitter Co-founder Biz Stone and Kunal Bahl of Snapdeal. Don't just take take our word.

We supply the hardware and split the revenues. Because 100 of our machines is equivalent to 6000 Intel servers, we cut our customer's AWS bill in half. Response has been overwhelming. In year 5 we will close a sale of 2000 or more machines into top tier. That's $150M of profit for $3B valuation.",
