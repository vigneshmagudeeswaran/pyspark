Every such application is custom built. We should wonder — why? The desktop computer is an important interface for business applications. Problem is, it wasn’t built to perform modern business operations. The problem lies in the operating system. Where Android and iOS were designed to allow applications to interact with one another, desktop computing simply wasn’t. This means that operations such as deal analysis and loan processing, which toggle between human data and computer data, can’t be performed without the assistance of a human being.

The trucking industry faces major problems: a shortage of drivers, difficult working conditions, and extremely high turnover. According to the American Trucking Association, the industry faced a shortage of 51,000 commercial truck drivers at the end of 2017. Long-haul trucking is primed for autonomous technology. Highway driving is more structured and predictable than urban driving. This means there are fewer decisions for drivers to make and a better fit for autonomous vehicles. We believe that autonomous trucks will play a major role in filling the gap while improving safety, enhancing truck driver quality of life, increasing efficiency, reducing congestion and emissions and creating jobs across the economy.","Actively Hiring, Recently funded, Same investor as Groupon, Work / Life Balance, Strong Leadership",Mountain View,"Information Technology, Automotive, Robotics, Software, Logistics, Hybrid Vehicles, Trucking, Ground Transportation, Logistics / Transportation / Shipping","(Engineering: 9), (Investor: 6), (Other Engineering: 5), (Product: 1), (Sales: 1)"

Slate is already a key tool for social media sports teams at the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS, NCAA, and EPL followed by several other entertainment and media brands like Comedy Central, as well as adding top brands in fitness and beauty. Slate is a completely customizable mobile content creation app for top-tier social media teams to create branded content. When creating real-time content, enterprise social teams are forced to settle for colors that are “close” and fonts that “look less than cool”. Native options for graphics, stickers and filters are limited and don’t match the brand’s voice and image. But with today's consumer and fan in constant need of more content, there is no time to send every piece of captured media back and forth with the design team. This is when Slate jumps in to provide teams with a simple app that is fully customized to your brand; any fonts, graphics, logos, animated stickers, filters and sponsored overlays you need to create recognizable, quality content that is on brand, in real time. *Fun Fact: Slate was named to Fast Company's list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies for 2022 as No. 2 in the Video category!","Actively Hiring, Growing fast","New York City, Portland, London, Ukraine, Remote","Digital Media, Social Media, SaaS, Enterprise Software, B2B, Sports, Fashion, Beauty, Social Media Marketing, Entertainment Industry, Higher Education","(Engineering: 3), (Sales: 2)"

Our mobile app empowers individuals to see in close to realtime, who says what in the conversation. Ava swiftly pairs smartphones in a room and picks up all the audio from the conversation, to show a color-coded transcript of the speakers. At business meetings, family dinners, social gatherings, you simply launch the app, and Ava does the rest.

Radius is a decentralized network that connects independent workers and teams to the best projects in web3.

We’re doing that by making it easy for protocols to distribute their tokens to users. We believe that by helping protocols solve token distribution, we’ll not only make crypto protocols more sustainable, but also help anyone in the world earn income through provable contribution rather than their background or credentials. RabbitHole has created an efficient way for protocols to distribute tokens by segmenting users based on on-chain & off-chain data. By completing on-chain tasks in various protocols, users build their on-chain resume, and earn token ownership. What problem are we solving? Protocols are constantly looking for new ways to find and engage users, but don’t have an easy way to do so. Tokens of these protocols often fall in the hands of speculators who sit on centralized exchanges, rather than users of these networks. On the other hand, new users in crypto have a difficult time in knowing where to start on their crypto journey and don’t know who to trust. Why are we solving this problem? By making it more efficient for protocols to distribute their token to network participants, we are both driving more participation to protocols and making it easier for users to increase their ownership in protocols rather than speculators. By increasing the number of token holders who are using the network, we are making the underlying protocol more sustainable, and putting more money in the pockets of users. Why are we different? RabbitHole is a group of crypto-natives who have years of experience in crypto. Compared to other crypto projects, we’re not building another Metaverse or protocol for risk — we’re focused on helping serve existing decentralized protocols and get their tokens in the hands of the right token holders. We believe in the potential of what crypto stands for and can become, but we know that today there’s a lot to improve.","Actively Hiring, Same investor as Meta",Los Angeles,"Blockchain / Cryptocurrency, Web3","(Designer: 1), (Engineering: 1), (Product: 1)"

That's why they are adopting the Enterprise Metaverse in the form of Digital twins. From a survey conducted by Gartner, 75% of businesses want to implement digital twins, but only 13% have implemented it so far; the other 62% have it on their roadmap but find it hard or don't have the direct skill set in the team to implement it. After all, it's not a simple task to create a working, scalable, and living virtual replica of your factories in 3D. It's really complicated, requires a specialized 3D development team and specialized engineers to do the job; thus out of the reach of many businesses. This is where we step in to bridge the gap by bringing the capabilities of NoCode into a 3D workspace that allows businesses to build 3D apps without writing any code or having to depend on a 3D team. Our product, Cloudworx Studio, is a web-based IDE that lets users build applications and workflows for 3D content without writing any code. Our current focus is to build applications for the Enterprise Metaverse in the form of digital twins that are powered by real-time data from sensors, equipment, processes, and interactions. Using Cloudworx Studio, users can import their 3D models, create animations, interactions, workflows and alerts on them; and link them with real-time IoT sensors data to build digital twins in a no-code fashion.","Actively Hiring, Recently funded",Bengaluru,"SaaS, Enterprise Software, Internet of Things, Smart Home","(Designer: 1), (Engineering: 3)"

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features: Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections. Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals. Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes. WalletHub’s initial focus was in the credit card space, and we quickly became the go-to credit card resource for consumers and industry professionals alike. Not only did the nonprofit group Consumer Action rate WalletHub as the best credit card website, but our industry research and expert opinions are featured in the national media far more often than any other company in the space. In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.","Actively Hiring, Growing fast",Washington DC,Fin Tech,"(Designer: 1), (Engineering: 22)"

Ultimately, such smoother negotiations allow landlords to attract and retain better tenants and capitalize on improved relationships. Underpinning all, is the fully automated capture of all legal and commercial data that determine risk and value. Because leasing data is collected throughout the leasing lifecycle, from inception to termination, it is industry-wide the most granular leasing data set, that allows Sericin to close the loop on fractured tenant acquisition and leasing data stitched together from CRMs, marketplaces, property management and analytics platforms.","Actively Hiring, Growing fast","Hong Kong, Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong","SaaS, Business Information Systems, Industrial Automation, Legal, Commercial Real Estate, Smart Building, Document Management, Document, Property, Legal Tech, Analytics / Data","(Engineering: 2), (Product: 1)"

This process occurs naturally, however, it takes 100 years to saturate, and we reduce it to 100 hours. C4C’s technology locks down the CO2 in concrete permanently even after demolition of buildings. Technology innovation lies in the CO2 carriers that are made from waste materials that are currently landfilled or burnt. For our Gen I technology, we reduce the concrete CO2 emission by 25%: Long term goal - 70% cheaper and 100% greener concrete.","Recently funded, 5% by CO2 sequestration using our process,, 20% CO2 mitigation by cement reduction (our concrete is 100% stronger so less cement is needed)",Nottingham,"Clean Technology, Construction, Carbon",(Other Engineering: 1)

Properties pay locators a commission out of their marketing budget for referring renters their way. We need an income, clients need a place to live, and properties need tenants. It’s a win-win-win! What is an Apartment Locator? An apartment locator is a licensed real estate agent that specializes in finding apartments for renters. Renting is a quicker process than buying and a renter will likely ask for help finding their next place when their lease ends. This pipeline-building process is a great first step into residential real estate— Smart City provides the opportunity to build your client network, to be ready when your renter is ready to buy a home. How It All Started:Smart City started in 2013 as a small apartment locating service in Dallas, Texas. In the early days, our founder and CEO Cassie Brown just wanted to help her friends find great places to live, but her innate drive to offer an amazing client experience quickly set Smart City apart from the competition. Since then, Smart City has taken big strides to disrupt the real estate industry by becoming a trusted and preferred partner for property management companies. We've cultivated a highly targeted lead generation engine that generates qualified rental leads to our team of licensed real estate agents across eight markets. Our agents put clients' needs first, delivering a personalized list of apartments to bring highly-interested and qualified traffic through the doors of our property partners.

We are looking to fast-track this change with our SaaS-based application, tailor-made to address the needs of modern and sustainable farms with soilless and precision farming techniques like Hydroponics, Aquaponics and Aeroponics. The ability to seamlessly integrate with any automation devices (like automated fertigation and climate-control IoT devices) adds value in making the solution end-to-end. Growing healthy and quality food is possible with technology, but the technology can be intimidating for the non-techies.

Hyre is a comprehensive HR platform that helps businesses of all sizes, across different industries, manage their shift-based workforce by providing the tools that enable them to thrive, including employee shift scheduling, automated timesheets, digital time clocks, team messaging, and a built-in temp staffing pool. But how did we get here?? Well... Hyre started as a hospitality platform aimed at transforming how event organizers (hotels and event venues) staff their events. Traditionally, when event organizers are short-staffed (which is 30-50% of the time), they call a traditional staffing agency that charges them an arm and a leg for staff who are getting paid minimum wage. These agencies operate in a manual fashion that results in poor quality, high costs, and unreliability to the event organizers. This is just 1 example of how the hospitality world is currently riddled with mundane processes that cost end users billions in inefficiencies, time, and human error. By creating a platform that allowed hospitality professionals to take control of their own staffing, Hyre was able to reduce our clients' costs by a minimum of 50%! But we didn't want to stop there... So, we expanded into new verticles (internal scheduling software) and industries (healthcare, logistics, etc). **Who do we work with? We currently work with high-end clients such as the Hilton, Delta, Westin, Marriott, Ritz Carleton, Compass Group, Sodexo, Extendicare, etc., across Ontario. And... how big is this problem?
